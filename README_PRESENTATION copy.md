ZapGoals: Decentralized Crowdfunding with Nostr Wallet Connect
[0:00–0:30] Introduction (30 seconds)
Hello everyone, I’m excited to present ZapGoals—a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Nostr protocol, with Nostr Wallet Connect, or NWC, at its core.

[0:30–1:30] Overview (1 minute)
ZapGoals empowers anyone to create, fund, and track progress toward goals using zaps—Nostr-based payments.
NWC enables users to connect their own wallets securely, authorize payments directly, and interact with the Nostr ecosystem without intermediaries.
By leveraging NWC, all transactions are user-controlled, private, and censorship-resistant.

[1:30–3:00] Judging Criteria (1.5 minutes)

Impact (30s):
ZapGoals solves the problem of transparent, decentralized crowdfunding. NWC is fundamental: it lets users connect their own wallets, authorize zaps directly, and maintain full custody of their funds—no custodians, no centralized payment processors.

Need (30s):
Traditional crowdfunding is centralized, with high fees and restrictions. The Nostr ecosystem needs a trustless, censorship-resistant alternative. With NWC, ZapGoals ensures all funds go directly from the funder’s wallet to the goal creator, with transparent tracking and user control.

Proof of Work (20s):
The project features a modular React codebase, deep integration with Nostr relays and NWC, and technical features like deduplication, live updates, and profile fetching.

Feasibility (20s):
ZapGoals is already functional: users can create and view goals, zap, and track progress, all powered by NWC. The codebase is clean and maintainable, and the project is executable within typical hackathon or grant timelines.

Bonus (10s):
Real-time zap stats, reply threads, and deep NWC integration make ZapGoals engaging and innovative.
