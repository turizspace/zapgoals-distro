- Nostr needs a trustless, censorship-resistant alternative.
- NWC ensures funds go directly from funder to creator, with transparency and user control.

---

## Slide 5: Proof of Work
- Mention the modular React + TypeScript codebase.
- Deep integration with Nostr relays and NWC.
- Technical features: deduplication, live updates, profile fetching.

---

## Slide 6: Feasibility
- The app is already functional: create/view goals, zap, track progress.
- NWC powers secure wallet connectivity and payment authorization.
- Codebase is clean and maintainable; robust user experience.

---

## Slide 7: Bonus
- Real-time zap stats and reply threads make it engaging.
- Deep NWC integration = seamless, secure payments.
- Clean UI and easy onboarding for new users.

---

## Slide 8: Features
- List features: create/view goals, zap with NWC, transparent progress, replies, profile integration.
- Emphasize user empowerment and transparency.

---

## Slide 9: How It Works
- Walk through the user journey:
  1. Connect wallet via NWC (secure, non-custodial)

  3. Share & fund (anyone can zap)
  4. Track progress (real-time updates)

---

## Slide 10: Tech Stack
